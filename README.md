# EMPLOYEE ATTRITION RATE

Data mining research into employee attrition rates using three supervised methods: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression

## Aim: 

To identify the supervised learning method that is most appropriate in predicting employee attrition rate using different classification metrics.

## Conclusion:

The results deduced from the classification for of the data set, showed that Random Forest had the highest results.
Future works should focus on using a well-balanced data set to predict employee attrition rate. Also, the models can be improved and more accurate results from the classification metrics can be deduced.
